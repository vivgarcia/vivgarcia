### Hi, I'm Viviana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior front-end developer with a passion for learning. I decided to get into web development because of my love for tech, life long learning and desire to challenge my self.

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Design for User Experience through Lesley University to help me build better websites. I also have my Digital Media A.A.S., an occupational skills award in web design, and a full-stack developer certificate from the University of Texas. 

I am currently seeking a full-time junior front-end developer position where I can hone my skills and be part of a team environment. 

A little about my self: I am a foodie, plants are my newest hobby and practice coding in my spare time. 

If you're seeing this, let's connect!
